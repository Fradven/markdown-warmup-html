## A funny story

I was once stuck in traffic for 6 hours in Bangkok the day after Chrismas. Since we were stuck for a while and walking seemed to be faster I went out of the taxi to get some food for the driver and myself and when I got back the taxi hadn't moved a bit!

 #### TL;DR
Got stuck in traffic and went to get food by foot and the car didn't move.
